<h1>wtf is this?</h1>

<p>welcome to klintinville. i am gack, and this is the best way i could think to

<h2>introducing: realms</h2>

<p>okay so we all want to play minecraft. we all know my bitch ass is never on to
host the world. and if we were going to start doing more real, structured smp's
over the breaks coming up and the summer, we need realms. i can host since i
have my microsoft account already linked and set up. it's $8 a month and we get a
month free, so we just need everyone who is interested in playing to donate a
little bit of money.

<h2>the smps</h2>

<p>we currently have two ideas for smps, and we can come up with more if we want.
the first idea is <strong>raffle smp</strong>. raffle smp would start with each
participating player inputting $5. we would start a realm and surround the entire
area we are playing in (starting out with a very large area, like the size of the
spawn map), and every day for a week we would shrink the border until it was
extremely small. if you die once, there is no rejoining. anyone can kill anyone
after the first day (there is a grace period obviously) and then the last person
alive at the end of the week gets the money (or the money minus the cost of realms).
